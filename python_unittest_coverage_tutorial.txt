unittest 
- pytest
- coverage.py 
- pytest-cov 

With all these things I achieve 100% Test Coverage in Python.
100% test coverage is the same as 100% code coverage, but from the perspective of your tests.

Steps in this video
Create files app.py and test_app.py
import unittest into test_app.py
create unit tests for non existent Fibonacci function
test, test fails
create Fibonacci function,
test passes.
install pytest with $ pip install pytest
run test using pytest
install coverage with $ pip install coverage
run 
$ coverage run app.py  #analyses file
$ coverage report -m    #outputs anaylsys and shows un covered lines
$ coverage html           # create a more concise html version of the report
I try out a few things and get 10% code coverage
I then install pytest-cov using
$ pip install pytest-cov
I then run 
$ pytest --cov=app
and modify the test_app.py file until I get 100% code coverage
I also generate a html version of the report using
$ pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
